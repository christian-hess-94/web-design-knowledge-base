It is possible to use more than one font per project. but a couple of rules should be followed:

- Don't use fonts that are too similar. try to avoid fonts of the same type. Try and match differente categories and see where it goes
- Use at most two fonts.
- Usually the more custom and [[Serif]] fonts are used for title, while [[Sans-Serif]] are used almost exclusively for blocks of text as they are the easiest to read
