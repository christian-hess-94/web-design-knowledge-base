This is the relation between the different, sizes, colors and relations of the various texts in the page. It's best to pick some hard set rules right at the start to avoid problems and confusion down the line

- Use at most 6 different sizes of fonts. this relates to the "four h's" of HTML.
- Pick sizes that are not too similar or close (12px text and 13px text are virtually the same to most people)
- Create an even-ish scale by jumping constant or multiplied numbers (2,4,6) between each size
