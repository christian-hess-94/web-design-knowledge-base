Like with any project, it's a great idea to have some kind of planning or bigger scope to follow before properly trying to build it.

Usually there are a few steps to follow:
- Make a search and poll for the needs of the target user audience
- Break all the nedds into [[Functional Requisites]]
- Structure and architect the requisites into small modules
- Design the interface and how these elements are displayed to the user
- Finally choose the actual specific: Fonts, Colors, Grid sizes, Spacing, etc

All of these step combined are what is called the "Visual Design" of the project.
