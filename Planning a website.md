Like with any project, it's a great idea to have some kind of planning or bigger scope to follow before properly trying to build it.

Usually there are a few steps to follow:
- Make a search and poll for the needs of the target user audience

- Structure and architect the requisites into small modules
- Desiggn the interface and how these elements are displayed to the user
