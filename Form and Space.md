#### Forms
Forms dictate the geometric appearance of an element in the page. The most common one are squares and rectangles, especially as they easily fit into the [[Grid]] of the page.

There are two main types:
![[Geometric Shapes]]
![[Organic Shapes]]

`Both themes can be used together. In this example, all the items are composed of Geometric Shapes, to keep everything organized. However small details like the underlining of links or the icons above are composed of imperfect, Natural Shapes`

#### Space
```
Space is defined and acquires meaning the instant a Form appears inside of it. 
- Timothy Samara
```

Space dictates the relations between the shapes that are inside of it, bringing attention or diverting from certain aspects of the page, and creating a Hierarchy of the elements contained within it.

`In this case, the entire right side of the page brings focus to the three action buttons, bringing the user to click on any of them. The left side is used to highlight the two latest points or stories associated with the brand.`

`This website has a video playing in the background, so it minimizes the elements in the page itself to not deter from it.`

`This one uses the space around the bold letters and the message of the brand to give focus to it's main purpose. This is a case where the space compliments the `[[Explaining]] `aspects of the design.`
