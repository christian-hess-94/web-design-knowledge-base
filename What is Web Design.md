Design in general is supposed to **add value and meaning** to something. It can achieve that by **simplifying**, **explaining**, **modifying**, **dignifying**, **dramatizing**, persuading and even entertaining those who interact with it.

### Adding value and meaning:

`In this case of an e-commerce, the entire page is tailored to the predominant male audience, and it used strong colors and bold lettering to appeal to that sense`

### Simplifying

`In this case the objective is to guide the viewer through an specific flow or route. This is done by enphasizing the most important elements that can be interacted with, the buttons.`
