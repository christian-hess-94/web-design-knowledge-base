Design in general is supposed to **add value and meaning** to something. It can achieve that by **simplifying**, **explaining**, **modifying**, **dignifying**, **dramatizing**, **persuading** and even **entertaining** those who interact with it.

### Adding value and meaning:

`In this case of an e-commerce, the entire page is tailored to the predominant male audience, and it used strong colors and bold lettering to appeal to that sense`

### Simplifying

`In this case the objective is to guide the viewer through an specific flow or route. This is done by enphasizing the most important elements that can be interacted with, the buttons.`

### Explaining

`In this case the website makes use of text to offer a easy and simple explanation about a general goal. In this case the use of titles and subtitles are proeminent ways of delivering this information.` [[Typography]]

### Dignifying

`This landing page for a product takes cues from the actual product's design and color scheme to implemente an entire UI centered on transmiting the feeling of owning that piece of design. Thus, the design of the webpage complements the content that it portrays.`
